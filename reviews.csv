 , ,0,N P,2020-12-19 00:00:00,5.0,"Does it's work nicely. Good to have the extra sediment filter over and above the 3 standard filters. The water nozzle could have been at an angle. It lets out water straight down quite close to the water purifier, thus splashing water over it unless the bottle is held quite close to the outlet. Can't fill water into larger utensils like steel matkas directly due to this issue, but the company provides with a thin water pipe for this purpose (it comes in the box). Keeping the pipe germ-free can be an issue.The issues of brown water or smelly water mentioned in some reviews could be because we need to let some water flow out before first use (due to carbon filter) . If not done, these issues will be witnessed. Have used it for more than a month now and am fully satisfied with water quality.Maintenance should be easy as the technician mentioned that the filters needs to be replaced only once in a year. With other brands it is usually once a quarter or every six months.",https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1JRUQFW8UL0NR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07TL45M93
